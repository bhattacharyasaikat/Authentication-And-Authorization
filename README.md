# Authentication and Authorization System
This project is an authentication and authorization system implemented using bcrypt for password hashing, JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for session management, and middleware for route protection. It provides secure user authentication and ensures that only authorized users can access protected routes.

## Features
**Secure Password Hashing:** User passwords are securely hashed using bcrypt before being stored in the database, ensuring that sensitive information is protected.

**JWT Authentication:** JSON Web Tokens are used for authentication, providing a secure and efficient way to manage user sessions.

**Authorization Middleware:** Middleware functions are implemented to protect routes, ensuring that only authenticated and authorized users can access certain endpoints.

**Flexible and Scalable:** The system is designed to be flexible and scalable, allowing for easy integration into various web applications and APIs
